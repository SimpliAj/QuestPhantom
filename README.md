## 📋 Overview

QuestPhantom is a developer console script that automatically completes Discord Quests. It uses webpack injection to access Discord's internal modules, handling various quest types with sequential processing and robust error handling.

> [!NOTE]
> Browser-based limitations: Game-related quests won't work in the browser. Use the [Discord Desktop App](https://discord.com/download) for full functionality.

3. **Navigate to the Console tab**
4. **Copy** the entire `main.js` file content

## 🤖 QuestHunter Discord Bot

QuestHunter is a Discord bot that complements QuestPhantom by sending notifications when new quests are detected in your server.

### Features
- 📬 **Auto-Notifications** - Sends alerts in a designated channel when new quests are detected
- ⚡ **Easy Setup** - Configure via simple slash commands
- 🔔 **Real-time Updates** - Instant notification of quest availability

### Installation

[**Invite QuestHunter to your Discord Server**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1474123878002462801&permissions=2147699712&integration_type=0&scope=bot)

Once invited, use slash commands to configure the bot and choose which channel receives quest notifications and get a spoofguide with a link for the latest main.js

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

### Internal Discord Modules Used

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **ApplicationStreamingStore** | Manages stream data and state |
| **RunningGameStore** | Tracks active games |
| **QuestsStore** | Stores quest data and user progress |
| **ChannelStore** | Provides channel information |
| **GuildChannelStore** | Guild-specific channel data |
| **FluxDispatcher** | Discord's event system |
| **API Module** | REST API for quest progress updates |

### How It Works

1. Injects webpack to access Discord's internal stores
2. Retrieves all active, uncompleted quests from QuestsStore
3. Identifies supported quest types (WATCH_VIDEO, PLAY_ON_DESKTOP, etc.)
4. Processes quests sequentially with appropriate handlers
5. For video quests: simulates watch progress with realistic timestamps
6. Logs all actions with timestamps and progress metrics
7. Auto-redeems quest rewards upon completion

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Script doesn't execute | Ensure you're using the **Discord Desktop App**, not the web version |
| Console shows errors | Verify you're **logged into Discord** and have active quests |
| Quests not detected | Check that quests are still **active** and not expired in your quest menu |
| Nothing happens | Look for error messages in the **Developer Tools Console** (red text) |
| API failures | Try closing/reopening Discord or running the script again |

---

## 📌 Notes

- Always **manually activate quests** in Discord before running the script
- The script runs **in the background** while the console is open
- **Keep Discord open** with the console running for the duration
- Quests are processed **one at a time** to avoid rate limiting
- Logs are printed to the console in JSON format for debugging
